                <h1>Kendra "Riley" Lamb</h1>
                <h2>Software Engineer and Artist</h2>
                <p>Hello there! I'm Kendra, but I go by Riley and I like to think of myself as a bit of a creative technologist. For the past 8 years, I've been navigating the exciting world of software engineering, where I've honed my skills and embraced the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
                    </br></br>
                    In my professional journey, I've become fluent in languages like Java, and mastered frameworks like Spring Boot and ZK UI. My coding adventures have taken me through the realms of backend to fullstack engineering, and I've danced my way to becoming a team lead in my current professional position.
                    </br></br>
                    But here's the twist â€” I'm not just a tech enthusiast; I'm also an artist at heart. My creative spirit finds expression through various media, including photography and digital art. Whether I'm crafting code or capturing moments with my camera, I believe in the power of storytelling in all its forms.
                    </br></br>
                    When I'm not immersed in the world of code, you'll find me weaving words as a writer. I enjoy the art of communication, and I've found that the skills I've developed in software engineering often have a poetic resonance.
                    </br></br>
                    In the realm of databases, I've navigated the depths of Oracle SQL and PostgresSQL. I've danced with Hibernate, and JPA, and have orchestrated projects seamlessly with JIRA.
                    </br></br>
                    A true hybrid, I'm proficient in both Windows and Unix-based systems, adapting effortlessly to whichever environment is needed for the task at hand.
                    </br></br>
                    Join me in this multifaceted journey where I merge the precision of code with the limitless creativity of art. Let's build something amazing together!</p>
